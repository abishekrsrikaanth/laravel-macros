The idea of creating this project is to have a repository of all the Macros that may have been rejected to be added to
the Laravel Framework. This package is a collection of useful string and array helpers that could not be added to the
Laravel Framework.

We still review and accept PRs for new macros that could be useful to the community. We will also be adding more macros
as we find them. But we will not be adding any macros that don't have a use case or are not useful to the community.

So we invite developers to come forward and contribute to this project by adding new macros that they find useful.
